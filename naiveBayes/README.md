## Naive Bayes' Algorithm
Naive Bayes(NB) classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model based on Baye's theorem. It is a very popular supervised learning algorithm used for problems like text classification, spam filtering, and recommendation systems. It belongs to the family of generative learning algorithms, which means that it models the distribution of the inputs for a given class or category.

Naive Bayes models are a group of extremely fast and simple classification algorithms that are often suitable for very high-dimensional datasets. Because they are so fast and have so few tunable parameters, they end up being very useful as a quick-and-dirty baseline for a classification problem.

It is called Naive Bayes because it makes a naive assumption features being independent,i.e,the features of the input data are conditionally independent given the class. This means we can calculate the likelihood of each feature separately. In simple terms NB assumes that presence of one feature is unrelated to the presence of another feature.

Coming down to the basics - Bayes' theorem is based on the probability of hypothesis, given the data and some prior knowledge.
