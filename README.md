# Machine Learning for Beginners
## Our mission - Enabling small-town girls to pursue a career in STEM

## Introduction to Machine Learning
Welcome to this course on classic Machine Learning. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced ML professional looking to brush up, we are happy to have you join us. In this course, you will be learning about classic machine-learning algorithms using Scikit-learn. Each Chapter consists of illustrations, a theoretical overview, and hands-on coding.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Over the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, and effective web search, and it is also giving us a continually improving understanding of the human genome.
